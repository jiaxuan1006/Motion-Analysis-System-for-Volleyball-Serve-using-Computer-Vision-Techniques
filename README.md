# Motion-Analysis-System-for-Volleyball-Serve-using-Computer-Vision-Techniques
This is a project to develop a motion analysis system for volleyball overhand serve. The system is developed using computer vision techniques such as object detection tracking using YOLOv4 , human pose estimation using MediaPipe Pose model.
The project is developed using OpenCV Python.
The website of the system is developed using Flask Python, DATABASE stored using Flask-sqlalchemy.
